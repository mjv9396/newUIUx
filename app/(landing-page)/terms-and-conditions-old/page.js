          any liability or losses incurred by Atmoon due to the imposition of

        <h6>3. PAYMENT </h6>
        <p>
          3.1. Atmoon may charge applicable fees for providing its services,
          which will be determined and updated at its sole discretion. You agree
          that these fees will be applied based on the specified rates, manner,
          and frequency set by Atmoon. These charges grant access to
          Atmoonâ€™s full suite of payment solutions, including the dashboard,
          custom reports, and applicable MDR charges as per regulatory
          guidelines. For clarity, Atmoon fees include zero MDR for RuPay
          Debit Card and UPI transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2. Fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, and Atmoon will
          occasionally charge such applicable taxes on the fees. You agree that
          you shall bear any statutory variations in applicable taxes during the
          subsistence of these Terms.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3.3. We will raise monthly invoices regarding fees charged for
          Services provided during such a month. Invoices are available on the
          dashboard every month. Any dispute regarding an invoice must be
          communicated by You to us via notice no later than ten (10) days from
          the invoice date. Atmoon shall use reasonable faith efforts to
          reconcile any reasonably disputed amounts.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3.4. You shall do daily reconciliation for all the transactions
          processed. In case of discrepancies, You shall report to Atmoon
          regarding such discrepancy within three (3) days upon the receipt of
          the funds. Atmoon shall not be liable for any reconciliation issue
          if you highlight the same to Atmoon after such time.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3.5. Suppose fees are deducted upfront before the provision of a
          specific service, and you deposit applicable taxes under Section 194H
          of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for invoices received by you). In that
          case, Atmoon will reimburse the corresponding tax amount every
          quarter upon submission of Form 16-A as proof of payment. In all other
          cases, for invoices received, you must withhold applicable taxes under
          Section 194H at the time of fee payment (if LTDC is provided as per
          the issued LTDC). You are responsible for depositing the withheld
          taxes with the government Treasury, filing the required returns, and
          providing Atmoon with Form 16-A within 180 days to ensure Atmoon
          can claim full credit for the deducted taxes.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          {" "}
          3.5A. Suppose you operate as an e-commerce platform facilitating the
          sale of goods or services by a resident e-commerce participant. In
          that case, you are responsible for assessing and complying with the
          Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) requirements under Section 194O of the
          Income Tax Act, 1961. As an e-commerce operator, you must withhold Tax
          under this section, deposit it within the prescribed timelines, and
          fulfill all necessary compliance requirements as per the law.
          Atmoon, a payment service provider, is not responsible for
          deducting Tax under Section 194O; this obligation rests solely with
          you as the e-commerce operator. For the purposes of this clause,
          "e-commerce operator" and "e-commerce participant" shall have the
          meanings defined under Section 194O of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3.6. You must update your GST registration number on the Atmoon
          dashboard before the invoice is generated. You must submit your GST
          certificate as part of the KYC process. Atmoon will issue a GST tax
          invoice and report transactions in GST returns based on your provided
          details. These returns will be filed within statutory timelines to
          ensure you can claim the appropriate input tax credit. Atmoon shall
          not be liable for any errors, omissions, or misrepresentations you
          made when updating your GST number or other details. If any liability
          arises on Atmoon due to incorrect information or deliberate
          withholding of statutory details by you, Atmoon reserves the right
          to recover such amounts from you.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3.6A. To ensure the issuance of a proper B2B tax invoice under GST law
          and facilitate your GST input credit, Atmoon will record your
          correct GSTIN. You are responsible for periodically verifying your
          GSTIN and registered address in your Atmoon account and updating
          any inaccuracies as needed. If your correct GSTIN is not updated in
          your account, you will bear full responsibility for any consequences.
          Atmoon will not be obligated to revise invoices or make amendments
          to GST reporting due to incorrect or missing GSTIN details you
          provided.

        <h6>9. CARD ASSOCIATION RULES </h6>
        <p>
          {" "}

          guidelines, processes, interpretations, and other contractual or
          otherwise requirements established by card payment networks. These
          networks provide the necessary infrastructure and systems for
          transaction authorization. You must comply with all applicable rules,
          guidelines, and regulations set by the card payment networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2. Card payment networks can update their guidelines, rules, and
          regulations periodically. As a result, we may need to modify these
          Terms to align with such changes. Any amendments made in compliance
          with updated Card Payment Network Rules will take effect immediately
          and be binding on you.

        <p>
          9.3. You agree to fully comply with all programs, guidelines, and
          requirements issued or mandated by card payment networks. While
          Atmoon may assist in understanding these rules, you acknowledge and
          accept full responsibility for ensuring compliance with all Card
          Payment Network Rules provisions, regardless of your awareness of or
          access to them. For reference, card networks such as MasterCard, Visa,
          Diners, RuPay, and American Express provide excerpts of their
          respective rules on their official websites.
        </p>

          demanded from Atmoon by a card payment network. In that case, you
          agree to promptly reimburse Atmoon for the full fines, penalties,
          or related expenses incurred. This is without prejudice to any other
          rights Atmoon may have under these Terms. Failure to fulfill your
          obligations towards the card payment networks may also lead to
          Atmoon suspending settlements or immediately suspending or
          terminating the Services.

          investigation or inquiry into alleged illegal activities is ongoing.
          <br />
          (d) You engage in transactions flagged as high-risk according to
          Atmoonâ€™s internal fraud detection tools and risk assessment
          policies.
          <br />
          (e) Atmoon has reasonable grounds to believe that your activities
          involve suspicious behavior.
          <br />
          (f) There are pending, anticipated, or excessive disputes,
          chargebacks, refunds, or reversals linked to your use of the Services.
          <br /> (g) Your products or services infringe, or are suspected of
          infringing, intellectual property rights, including copyrighted works,
          patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, or you are suspected of
          dealing in counterfeit or unauthorized goods.
          <br /> (h) You make significant changes to your products or services,
          as initially declared during onboarding, without Atmoonâ€™s prior
          written approval, or you provide false or misleading information
          regarding your offerings during onboarding.
          <br /> (i) Atmoon, at its sole discretion, determines that your
          activities pose unacceptable risks to its operations or reputation.
          <br /> (j) Atmoon is compelled to suspend services due to changes
          in regulations or compliance requirements affecting the Services.
          <br />
          15.1. These Terms become effective when you first access or use the
          Platform or Services and will remain in force until you or Atmoon
          terminates such access or usage. Unless you have a separate offline
          agreement governing your use of the Services, these Terms will apply
          in full. Atmoon reserves the right to terminate these Terms or
          close your account at any time, for any reason, including but not
          limited to activities that could damage Atmoonâ€™s reputation or
          goodwill. If applicable laws require prior notice before termination,
          Atmoon will provide you with the necessary advance notice following
          those legal requirements.
          <br />
          15.2. Termination of these Terms does not immediately release you from
          any obligations incurred before termination. Upon termination, you
          agree to cease using the Services. If you continue or resume using the
          Services after termination, it will be considered as your renewed
          acceptance of these Terms. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree
          that Atmoon will not be responsible for any compensation,
          reimbursement, or damages arising from your use of the Services, the
          termination or suspension of Services, or the deletion of your account
          or related data. You will remain responsible for any outstanding fees,
          fines, or other financial obligations incurred through your use of the
          Services before termination.
